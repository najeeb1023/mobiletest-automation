WALKTHROUGH FOR MOBILE AUTOMATION (VS CODE, APPIUM, WEBDRIVERIO, MOCHA, BABEL)

This is a walkthrough for the mobile automation task (developing smoke test cases into automated test cases), to run the project successfully you need to VS Code, Appium, WebdriverIO, Mocha and Babel.

Commands to be executed once in VS code’s terminal:

  	1) Nodejs should be installed in the system to run node commands (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
	2) npm install appium
	3) npm install Appium-doctor
	4) npm install webdriverio
	5) npm install mocha, chai and chalk (all are interconnected)
	6) npx wdio config (to get a configuration file for WebDriverIO)

You’ll also require android studio/xcode to have a smartphone simulator to install and run your tests.
